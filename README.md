# Q - A Data Language

*Q* is a data language. For now, it is limited to a data definition language
(DDL). Think "JSON/XML schema", but the correct way. *Q* comes with a dedicated
type system for defining data and a theory, called *information contracts*, for
interoperability with programming and data exchange languages.
